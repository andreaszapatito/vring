abstract = {A new expiratory droplet investigation system (EDIS) was used to conduct the most comprehensive program of study to date, of the dilution corrected droplet size distributions produced during different respiratory activities. Distinct physiological processes were responsible for specific size distribution modes. The majority of particles for all activities were produced in one or more modes, with diameters below 0.8 $\mu$m at average concentrations up to 0.75 cm-3. These particles occurred at varying concentrations, during all respiratory activities, including normal breathing. A second mode at 1.8 $\mu$m was produced during all activities, but at lower concentrations of up to 0.14 cm-3. Speech produced additional particles in modes near 3.5 and 5 $\mu$m. These two modes became most pronounced during sustained vocalization, producing average concentrations of 0.04 and 0.16 cm-3, respectively, suggesting that the aerosolization of secretions lubricating the vocal chords is a major source of droplets in terms of number. For the entire size range examined of 0.3-20 $\mu$m, average particle number concentrations produced during exhalation ranged from 0.1 cm-3 for breathing to 1.1 cm-3 for sustained vocalization. Non-equilibrium droplet evaporation was not detectable for particles between 0.5 and 20 $\mu$m, implying that evaporation to the equilibrium droplet size occurred within 0.8 s. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An essential starting point when investigating the potential role of human expired aerosols in the transmission of disease is to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the expired aerosol generation process, including the aerosol size distribution, the various droplet production mechanisms involved and the corresponding sites of production within the respiratory tract. In order to approach this level of understanding we have integrated the results of two different investigative techniques spanning 3 decades of particle size from 700. nm to 1. mm, presenting a single composite size distribution, and identifying the most prominent modes in that distribution. We link these modes to specific sites of origin and mechanisms of production. The data for this were obtained using the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) covering the range 0.7≤ d≤20 $\mu$m and Droplet Deposition Analysis (DDA) covering the range d≥20$\mu$m.In the case of speech three distinct droplet size distribution modes were identified with count median diameters at 1.6, 2.5 and 145$\mu$m. In the case of voluntary coughing the modes were located at 1.6, 1.7 and 123$\mu$m. The modes are associated with three distinct processes: one occurring deep in the lower respiratory tract, another in the region of the larynx and a third in the upper respiratory tract including the oral cavity. The first of these, the Bronchiolar Fluid Film Burst (BFFB or B) mode contains droplets produced during normal breathing. The second, the Laryngeal (L) mode is most active during voicing and coughing. The third, the Oral (O) cavity mode is active during speech and coughing. The number of droplets and the volume of aerosol material associated with each mode of aerosol production during speech and coughing is presented. The size distribution is modeled as a tri-modal lognormal distribution dubbed the Bronchiolar/Laryngeal/Oral (B.L.O.) tri-modal model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The Influenza A H1N1 virus can be transmitted via direct, indirect, and airborne route to non-infected subjects when an infected patient coughs, which expels a number of different sized droplets to the surrounding environment as an aerosol. The objective of the current study was to characterize the human cough aerosol pattern with the aim of developing a standard human cough bioaerosol model for Influenza Pandemic control.Method: 45 healthy non-smokers participated in the open bench study by giving their best effort cough. A laser diffraction system was used to obtain accurate, time-dependent, quantitative measurements of the size and number of droplets expelled by the cough aerosol.Results: Voluntary coughs generated droplets ranging from 0.1 - 900 microns in size. Droplets of less than one-micron size represent 97% of the total number of measured droplets contained in the cough aerosol. Age, sex, weight, height and corporal mass have no statistically significant effect on the aerosol composition in terms of size and number of droplets.Conclusions: We have developed a standard human cough aerosol model. We have quantitatively characterized the pattern, size, and number of droplets present in the most important mode of person-to-person transmission of IRD: the cough bioaerosol. Small size droplets (< 1 $\mu$m) predominated the total number of droplets expelled when coughing. The cough aerosol is the single source of direct, indirect and/or airborne transmission of respiratory infections like the Influenza A H1N1 virus.Study design: Open bench, Observational, Cough, Aerosol study. {\textcopyright} 2012 Zayas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {This work investigated the size distribution of the droplet nuclei and coughed droplets by test subjects. The size distributions of droplet nuclei coughed by test subjects were determined with an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) system (system 1). Coughed droplets were only sampled with the APS system (system 2). Two different schemes were employed in system 2. Furthermore, the size distribution of coughed droplets of different ages and gender was investigated to identify the effects of age and gender on droplet size distribution. Results indicated the total average size distribution of the droplet nuclei was 0.58-5.42 $\mu$m, and 82% of droplet nuclei centered in 0.74-2.12 $\mu$m. The entire average size distribution of the coughed droplets was 0.62-15.9 $\mu$m, and the average mode size was 8.35 $\mu$m. The size distribution of the coughed droplets was multimodal. The size distribution of coughed droplets showed three peaks at approximately 1 $\mu$m, 2 $\mu$m, and 8 $\mu$m. These analytical findings indicate that variation for average droplet size among the three age groups was insignificant (p > 0.1). Moreover, the variation in average droplet size between males and females was also insignificant (p > 0.1). Also, the variation in droplet concentration between males and females was significant (p > 0.1). Droplet nuclei concentrations from male subjects were considerably higher than that from females. Comparison of the droplet concentrations for subjects in different age groups demonstrated that subjects in the 30-50-year age group have the largest droplet concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Aerosol production during normal breathing is often attributed to turbulence in the respiratory tract. That mechanism is not consistent with a high degree of asymmetry between aerosol production during inhalation and exhalation. The objective was to investigate production symmetry during breathing. Methods: The aerosol size distribution in exhaled breath was examined for different breathing patterns including normal breathing, varied breath-holding periods, and contrasting inhalation and exhalation rates. The aerosol droplet size distribution measured in the exhaled breath was examined in real time using an aerodynamic particle sizer. Results and Conclusions: The dependence of the particle concentration decay rate on diameter during breath holding was consistent with gravitational settling in the alveolar spaces. Also, deep exhalation resulted in a four- to sixfold increase in concentration, and rapid inhalation produced a further two- to threefold increase in concentration. In contrast, rapid exhalation had little effect on the measured concentration. A positive correlation of the breath aerosol concentration with subject age was observed. The results were consistent with the breath aerosol being produced through fluid film rupture in the respiratory bronchioles in the early stages of inhalation and the resulting aerosol being drawn into the alveoli and held before exhalation. The observed asymmetry of production in the breathing cycle with very little aerosol being produced by exhalation is inconsistent with the widely assumed turbulence-induced aerosolization mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Droplets carried in exhaled breath may carry microorganisms capable of transmitting disease over both short and long distances. The size distribution of such droplets will influence the type of organisms that may be carried as well as strategies for controlling airborne infection. The aim of this study was to characterize the size distribution of droplets exhaled by healthy individuals. Exhaled droplets from human subjects performing four respiratory actions (mouth breathing, nose breathing, coughing, talking) were measured by both an optical particle counter (OPC) and an analytical transmission electron microscope (AEM). The OPC indicated a preponderance of particles less than 1 $\mu$, although larger particles were also found. Measurements with the AEM confirmed the existence of larger sized droplets in the exhaled breath. In general, coughing produced the largest droplet concentrations and nose breathing the least, although considerable intersubject variability was observed.},
